# Streaming-data-ETL-pipeline-using-Microsoft-Azure-and-Databricks-tech-stack

This is a Proof-of-Concept (POC) project which involves development of batch and streaming data pipelines to analyze real-time accidents data.

The streaming data pipeline developed in this project is an efficient solution for healthcare facilities as the staff will be notified of any accident immediately upon its occurrence, as soon as the accident happens.

Moreover, this pipeline will also tend to notify several government departments and authorities related to traffic incidents such as incident response management, highway authority and traffic police departments, so that they can take swift actions upon any issues caused by the accident such as controlling the traffic flow, managing alternate routes etc.

The dataset used for this project is data of accidents that occurred between 2016 and 2021 in the United States. It consists of 2.8 million rows and 47 columns. The columns are divided into 14 numerical and 33 categorical features. Some of the features the dataset is demonstrating include the accidentâ€™s severity, description, city, state, county, time at which the accident occurred, time at which the traffic flow has resumed after the accident, along with many other numerical and categorical features.
